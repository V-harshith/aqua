## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Step 1: Pre-Deployment Cleanup**
```bash
# Remove debug functionality
rm -rf src/app/api/debug/
rm debug_*.sql
rm fix_*.sql

# Verify build
npm run build
npm run start  # Test production build locally
```

### **Step 2: Environment Setup**
Create production environment variables in Vercel:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_production_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_production_service_role_key
NODE_ENV=production
```

### **Step 3: Database Migration**
```sql
-- Run in production Supabase SQL Editor:
-- 1. Execute: database_migrations/00_complete_setup.sql
-- 2. Create admin user
-- 3. Verify RLS policies are active
```

### **Step 4: Vercel Deployment**
```bash
# Connect repository to Vercel
1. Import project from GitHub
2. Set environment variables
3. Deploy automatically
4. Test all functionality
```

### **Step 5: Post-Deployment Verification**
```bash
# Test checklist after deployment:
□ Authentication works for all roles
□ Dashboard data loads correctly
□ Forms submit successfully
□ PWA installs on mobile
□ All API endpoints respond
□ Database connections secure
□ Rate limiting active
```
